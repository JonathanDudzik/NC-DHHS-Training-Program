                    <h5>Project description:</h5>
                    <p>I was hired as an instructional designer to help the Child and Adult Nutrition branch of the NC DHHS meet federal training requirements, improve public perception of our training program, and expand our asynchronous online course offerings. I started by creating e-learning courses in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but after my branch purchased Articulate 360, I began using Storyline and Rise.</p>

                    <h5>Overview:</h5>
                    <p>I collaborated with SMEs, created the majority of our online courses, and managed all aspects of our Adobe LMS.</p>

                    <h5>Challenges:</h5>
                    <p>The main issue I had to address as the new instructional designer was that the SMEs were creating the training content and were reluctant to give that responsibility to someone else. However, without any guidance, their training was inconsistent, dull, and poorly received by many of the adult learners.</p>

                    <h5>Execution:</h5>
                    <p>I started in my role by asking the SMEs questions, talking to them about their pain points, and showing them how to improve their webinars. The most important thing I did was demonstrate that their role as SMEs was integral, but I could fix their pain points and enhance our training if they handed over the technical and design elements of the e-learning development to me.</p>

                    <h5>Reflection:</h5>
                    <p>Once the SMEs saw the amazing online training I was able to create with their guidance and feedback, they loved the idea of having me take the reins. I was able to achieve great things at the NC DHHS. The SMEs and upper management respected me as an expert in instructional design (likewise, I always showed respect for them as experts in their fields). I was also able to greatly improve our online training presence and the feedback we received from our adult learners.</p>
